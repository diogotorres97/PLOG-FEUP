# PLOG-FEUP

Repository to host Logic Programming projects.

PLOG is a course given at the FEUP in the 3rd year of the MIEIC.
 
## Project 1
In this project we implemented, in Prolog, a [Froglet](http://brainking.com/en/GameRules?tp=54) game for two players, accordingly to the rules designed by the original creator.
The game was build using a simplified text interface and allows the user to play in the following modes: Human/Human, Human/Computer, Computer/Computer. 

A graphic interface was developed for this game in the Graphical Applications Laboratory course. If you are interested, check it [here]().

## Project 2
The goal of this project was to build a program in LPC (Logic Programming with Constraints) that could solve any [Doppelblock](http://logicmastersindia.com/lmitests/dl.asp?attachmentid=659&view=1) puzzle.

## Technologies
* Prolog as programming language
* SICStus as development system
* Integrated SICStus module - clp(FD)
